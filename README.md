# Elastic_Collisions_Simulator
Developed a 2D particle collision simulator demonstrating elastic collisions, momentum conservation, and real-time motion physics.

Implemented wall and inter-particle collision detection with accurate physics calculations using object-oriented C++ design.

Built interactive console visualization to display particle movement and collisions in real-time.

Designed scalable architecture allowing multiple particles with randomized positions and velocities.
